# Individual Reflection

### Personal Contribution:

##### Topic Selection

- Browsed and marked a wide range of datasets for topic selection.
- Discovered the powerlifting dataset that we use for the project.
- Discussed within the group for potentially interesting topics, and played an active role in the decision making. 

##### Visualization Design

- Played the leading role in the group for coming up with all three initial ideas, of which 2 ideas are eventually implemented in 3 components.
- Participated in making the sketch and writing the planning document.

##### Code Implementation

- Implemented the interactive 2-D scatterplot, with features of:
  - information displaying and color coding
  - zooming in and out
  - brushing
  - performance tracing
  - lifter highlighting

##### Report Writing

- Contributed to 
  - setting up the LaTeX format of the report
  
  - writing sections of: 
  
    - Problem Analysis/ Introduction section,
  
    - Interactive Scatterplot part of Proposed and justified solution section,
  
    - Interactive Scatterplot part of Evaluation section,
  
    - Discussion/ Conclusion section.
  
      

### Conclusion: 

Throughout the project, I took initiative in all aspects within the group and my work addressed multiple abstracted tasks of the visualization. In general, my self-reflection is positive.
